# Inbox Triage Proposal

**Created:** 2026-02-03T19:06:01Z
**From Agent:** inbox-poller
**Items Found:** 3

## Proposed Actions

### Item: IMG_8245.jpeg

**What it is:** Handwritten notes titled "Priorities" containing Quality of Life improvements list

**What I read:**
- Quality of Life items:
  - Rendering glitches - edges too close (z-fighting)
  - Voids rendering strangely
  - Functionality such as toggle face buttons not showing
  - Axis running through assembly rather than an arrow
  - Feet being operations on panels (crossed out "want")
  - Easier to change tab direction on lids
  - Edge selection neater in 3D view
  - Move tool on edges?
  - Inset tool change name?
  - Push pull tool awkward

**What I think you want:** These are QoL priorities for the current focus period. I note these items are **already captured** in `current-priorities.md` under "Quality of Life Items (from user notes)".

**Proposed action:**
- Category: priorities (but already processed)
- No changes needed to `current-priorities.md` - content already present
- Archive original to `processed/`

**Confidence:** High - This appears to be the source document for existing priorities.

### Item: IMG_8246.jpeg

**What it is:** Handwritten notes titled "2D View Priorities" with specific feature requests for the 2D panel editing view

**What I read:**
- Clean up lines + legend
  - Show mechanical joints + forbidden areas
  - Thinner lines
- Snapping improvements:
  - Center line of panel
  - Edge lines
  - Extend lines and snap points to them
  - e.g. easy to draw a central circle
- Edge mirroring:
  - When altering an edge path, should be an option to mirror changes in the palette
  - Any points drawn on one edge are duplicated + applied on other side
  - (Includes small diagram showing points A and B mirrored across center axis)

**What I think you want:** These are feature requests for enhancing the 2D panel editing view. They fall into three categories:
1. Visual polish (legend, line weights)
2. Snapping system (center lines, edge lines, construction lines)
3. Edge mirroring feature (symmetry tool for edge modifications)

**Proposed action:**
- Create `classified/features/2026-02-03-2d-view-legend-polish.md` - visual improvements (legend, thinner lines, show joints/forbidden areas)
- Create `classified/features/2026-02-03-2d-view-snapping.md` - snapping to center lines, edge lines, extended construction lines
- Create `classified/features/2026-02-03-edge-mirroring.md` - symmetry option when editing edge paths
- Archive original to `processed/`

**Confidence:** High

### Item: IMG_8247.jpeg

**What it is:** Handwritten notes continuing 2D editing features, specifically about shape/cutout workflow and copy-paste functionality

**What I read:**
- When a shape is drawn + cutout panel appears:
  - Allow moving it before applying
- Allow copying + pasting features:
  - e.g. custom edge, cutouts, extension
  - Allowed between panels around central axis (front, left, right, back) and top + bottom
  - Must also match openness
- Allow clip mask creation
- Allow bitmap in clip mask
  - Default clip mask = safe areas
  - Maximum clip mask = panel face
- Allow filleting all corners that are eligible

**What I think you want:** More 2D editing workflow improvements:
1. Move cutout preview before committing
2. Copy/paste edge features between compatible panels
3. Clip mask system for constraining drawing area
4. Batch fillet operation for corners

**Proposed action:**
- Create `classified/features/2026-02-03-cutout-preview-movement.md` - allow repositioning cutout shape before applying
- Create `classified/features/2026-02-03-feature-copy-paste.md` - copy/paste edge modifications between compatible panels
- Create `classified/features/2026-02-03-clip-mask-system.md` - clip masks for drawing constraints with bitmap support
- Create `classified/features/2026-02-03-batch-fillet-corners.md` - fillet all eligible corners at once
- Archive original to `processed/`

**Confidence:** High

  2. 2D view snapping system
  3. Edge mirroring/symmetry tool
  4. Cutout preview movement
  5. Feature copy/paste between panels
  6. Clip mask system
  7. Batch fillet corners

**Total files to create:** 7 feature summaries in `classified/features/`
**Files to archive:** 3 images to `processed/`
