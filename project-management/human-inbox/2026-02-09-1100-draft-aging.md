## Drafts WITH Open Questions (no tasks proposed)

### 1. Event Sourcing Proposal (6 days old)
**Source:** event-sourcing-proposal.md -> archived to project-management/archive/boxen/event-sourcing-proposal.md

**Summary:** Snapshot-based undo/redo system with command history, visual timeline, and operation integration.

**Open Questions (need your input):**
- How large will full snapshots be? Should we profile and optimize?
- What checkpoint frequency? (proposed: every 10 commands)
- What history limit? (proposed: 100 commands)
- Should sub-assembly edits have separate history stacks?

### 2. Move Operation Plan (10 days old)
**Source:** move-operation-plan.md -> archived to project-management/archive/boxen/move-operation-plan.md

**Summary:** New "move" operation to reposition divider panels along their perpendicular axis with collision detection.

**Open Questions (need your input):**
- Should moving a grid divider break the grid into individual subdivisions?
- How to handle moving dividers that have cross-lap joints with perpendicular dividers?
- Should there be a "distribute evenly" button to reset equal spacing?
- Keyboard shortcuts for nudging (arrow keys)?

### 3. Panel 2D Editing Plan (5 days old)
**Source:** panel-2d-editing-plan.md -> archived to project-management/archive/boxen/panel-2d-editing-plan.md

**Summary:** Custom panel geometry (edge paths, cutouts, 2D editing tools). Phases 1-5 mostly complete; outstanding work in later phases.

**Open Questions (need your input):**
- Should custom edge paths support curves (bezier) or only polylines?
- How to handle cutouts that would make panel structurally unsound?
- Should there be preset shape libraries (common handle shapes, vent patterns)?
- Edge path coordinate system — see linked analysis doc

### 4. Playwright Visual Testing Plan (10 days old)
**Source:** playwright-visual-testing-plan.md -> archived to project-management/archive/boxen/playwright-visual-testing-plan.md

**Summary:** Visual regression tests using Playwright to catch rendering artifacts in 3D operations.

**Open Questions (need your input):**
- Should we test both 3D and 2D viewports or focus on 3D?
- Fixed isometric camera view, or multiple angles per test?
- CI rendering: headless Chrome or xvfb for GPU rendering?
- Snapshot storage: Git LFS or separate artifact storage?

### 5. Sub-Assembly Operations Plan (6 days old)
**Source:** subassembly-operations-plan.md -> archived to project-management/archive/boxen/subassembly-operations-plan.md

**Summary:** Ensure all operations work on sub-assembly panels with proper constraints and collision validation.

**Open Questions (need your input):**
- Should linked sub-assembly instances share internal subdivisions?
- How to handle copy/paste across different projects/files?
- Should there be a "fit to void" operation that auto-sizes sub-assembly?

### 9. Panel Operations Plan (5 days old)
**Source:** panel-operations-plan.md -> archived to project-management/archive/boxen/panel-operations-plan.md
