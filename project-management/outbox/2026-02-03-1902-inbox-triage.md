# Inbox Triage Proposal

**Created:** 2026-02-03T19:02:58Z
**From Agent:** inbox-poller
**Items Found:** 3

## Summary

All 3 inbox items appear to be **duplicates** of already-processed files. The MD5 hashes match files in `processed/`, and summaries already exist in `classified/features/`.

## Proposed Actions

### Item: IMG_8245.jpeg

**What it is:** Handwritten notes titled "Priorities - Quality of Life" listing rendering glitches, UI/UX issues, and tool improvements.

**What I think you want:** Track these as quality-of-life priorities.

**Current status:** This content has ALREADY been processed:
- The `current-priorities.md` file contains all these items under "Quality of Life Items"
- A copy of this file exists in `processed/IMG_8245.jpeg` (identical MD5: a4138bddc088709067e372f672cedd7b)

**Proposed action:**
- Delete duplicate from `inbox/` (already processed)
- No new classification needed

**Confidence:** High

### Item: IMG_8246.jpeg

**What it is:** Handwritten notes titled "2d View Priorities" covering line cleanup, snapping improvements, and edge mirroring.

**Current status:** ALREADY processed:
- Summary exists at `classified/features/2026-02-03-2d-view-improvements.md`
- A copy exists in `processed/IMG_8246.jpeg`

**Proposed action:**
- Delete duplicate from `inbox/` (already processed)
- No new classification needed

**Confidence:** High

### Item: IMG_8247.jpeg

**What it is:** Handwritten notes about shape drawing UX, copy/paste features, clip masks, and fillet corners.

**Current status:** ALREADY processed:
- Summary exists at `classified/features/2026-02-03-shape-drawing-and-clipboard.md`
- A copy exists in `processed/IMG_8247.jpeg`

**Proposed action:**
- Delete duplicate from `inbox/` (already processed)
- No new classification needed

**Confidence:** High

---

## Summary

- 0 items → new classifications
- 3 items → duplicates to delete

**Question:** These files appear in both `inbox/` and `processed/` with identical MD5 hashes. Were they accidentally re-added, or is there a sync issue?

**Proposed cleanup:**
```bash
rm inbox/IMG_8245.jpeg inbox/IMG_8246.jpeg inbox/IMG_8247.jpeg
```
