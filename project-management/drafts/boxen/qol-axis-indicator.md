## Summary

The axis indicator runs through the assembly rather than being shown as an arrow (like typical 3D software axis indicators).

## Questions

### 1. Desired style?

- [ ] Corner arrows (like Blender/CAD - small XYZ arrows in corner)
- [ ] Origin arrows (XYZ arrows at world origin, not through model)
- [ ] Gizmo on selection (arrows appear on selected object)
- [ ] Hide axis entirely
- [ ] Other

### 2. Where should it appear?

- [ ] Fixed corner of viewport (bottom-left typical)
- [ ] At assembly origin
- [ ] At selection center
- [ ] User configurable

### 3. Should it show orientation only or allow interaction?

- [ ] Orientation only (just shows which way is X/Y/Z)
- [ ] Clickable to snap view to axis
- [ ] Full rotation gizmo
