## Summary

Feature requests for improving the 2D panel editing view.

## Items

### Clean Up Lines & Legend
- Show mechanical joints and forbidden areas in the legend
- Use thinner lines for better clarity

### Snapping Improvements
- Snap to center line of panel
- Snap to edge lines
- Extend lines and snap points to them
- Goal: Make it easy to draw a central circle (or other centered shapes)

### Edge Mirroring
- When altering an edge path, add an option in the palette to mirror changes
- Any points drawn on one edge are duplicated and applied on the other side
- Diagram shows: points A and B on left edge mirrored to corresponding points A' and B' on right edge

## Context

These improvements would make the 2D editing experience more precise and efficient, especially for creating symmetric designs.
