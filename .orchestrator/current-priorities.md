# Current Priorities

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-03
**Focus Period:** Quality of Life & Polish

## Primary Focus
1. **Quality of Life Improvements** - Rendering and interaction polish
2. Complete 2D panel editing tools (cutouts, edge paths)
3. Fix tracked issues in docs/issues/

## Work Categories (in priority order)
1. **Bugs/Issues** - Tracked issues take precedence
2. **QoL/Polish** - Rendering glitches, UI improvements
3. **In-Progress Plans** - Complete what's started before starting new
4. **New Features** - Only if aligned with primary focus

## Quality of Life Items (from user notes)
### Rendering
- Rendering glitches - edges too close (z-fighting)
- Voids rendering strangely

### UI/UX
- Toggle face buttons not showing (functionality issue)
- Axis running through assembly - should be an arrow instead
- Feet being operations on panels (unclear if bug or feature request)
- Easier to change tab direction on lids
- Edge selection neater in 3D view
- Move tool on edges (feature question)
- Inset tool - consider name change?
- Push-pull tool awkward to use

## Not Now
- New operation types (wait for core stability)
- Performance optimization (premature)
- Additional export formats
- Sub-assembly advanced features

## Groomer Guidance
- Prioritize QoL items from the list above
- Prioritize items from docs/issues/ index
- Break down in-progress plans into single-task proposals
- Look for work that can be parallelized without conflicts
- Flag items that need user clarification → outbox

## PM Guidance
- Prefer completing in-progress work over starting new
- Balance: 40% bugs/QoL, 40% in-progress plans, 20% new aligned work
- Don't queue more than 3 tasks at a time
- Consider dependency graph for parallel execution
