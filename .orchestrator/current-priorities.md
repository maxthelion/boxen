# Current Priorities

**Last Updated:** 2025-02-03
**Focus Period:** Core Stability & 2D Editing

## Primary Focus
1. Complete 2D panel editing tools (cutouts, edge paths)
2. Fix tracked issues in docs/issues/
3. Improve first-run user experience

## Work Categories (in priority order)
1. **Bugs/Issues** - Tracked issues take precedence
2. **In-Progress Plans** - Complete what's started before starting new
3. **Architectural Improvements** - Only if they unblock primary focus
4. **New Features** - Only if aligned with primary focus

## Not Now
- New operation types (wait for core stability)
- Performance optimization (premature)
- Additional export formats
- Sub-assembly advanced features

## Groomer Guidance
- Prioritize items from docs/issues/ index
- Break down in-progress plans into single-task proposals
- Look for work that can be parallelized without conflicts
- Flag items that need user clarification → outbox

## PM Guidance
- Prefer completing in-progress work over starting new
- Balance: 50% bugs/issues, 30% in-progress plans, 20% new aligned work
- Don't queue more than 3 tasks at a time
- Consider dependency graph for parallel execution
