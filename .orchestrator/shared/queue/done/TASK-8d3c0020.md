CREATED_BY: human

## Context
We need a script that answers "what have we been doing today?" by aggregating activity from multiple sources. It should be callable via a /today slash command.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] - Script runs without errors: .orchestrator/venv/bin/python .orchestrator/scripts/today.py
- [ ] - Shows today's git commits from both main repo and orchestrator submodule
- [ ] - Shows tasks completed, created, and in-progress today (from DB)
- [ ] - Shows new/changed files in project-management/
- [ ] - Handles edge case: no activity today (shows 'No activity' per section)
- [ ] - Skill file created at .claude/commands/today.md
- [ ] - Write notes about design decisions as you work
- [ ] Requirements:
- [ ] Script: .orchestrator/scripts/today.py
- [ ] 1. Git activity (today's commits on main)
- [ ] - git log --since="midnight" --oneline on the main repo
- [ ] - git log --since="midnight" --oneline in the orchestrator submodule
- [ ] - Group by area (orchestrator vs app code)
- [ ] 2. Unstaged/untracked changes in project-management/
- [ ] - New drafts, postmortems, plans added today
- [ ] - Modified files (use git status project-management/)
- [ ] 3. Task summary from DB
- [ ] - Tasks completed today (queue=done, check updated_at for today)
- [ ] - Tasks created today (created_at for today)
- [ ] - Tasks currently in progress (queue=claimed)
- [ ] - Include task ID, title, and role
- [ ] 4. Agent activity
- [ ] - Which agents ran today (check task_history for today's events)
- [ ] - Commits per agent
- [ ] Output: Human-readable markdown-style summary, grouped by section.
- [ ] Skill: .claude/commands/today.md — runs the script and displays output.
