## Context
Run the tests created in task 1 to verify they now pass: `npm run test:run -- tests/integration/serialization/urlState.test.ts`. If any fail, debug and fix. Then add additional edge case tests: (1) panel with zero-radius fillet (should be omitted), (2) multiple panels with different operations, (3) panel operations combined with edge extensions and subdivisions, (4) verify geometry validity after restore with `checkGeometry()`. Ensure all existing urlState tests still pass.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All new panel operations tests pass
- [ ] All existing urlState.test.ts tests still pass
- [ ] Edge case tests added for zero values, multiple panels, combined features
- [ ] Geometry validation passes after deserialization
