## Context
Create comprehensive tests in `/Users/maxwilliams/dev/boxen/tests/integration/serialization/urlState.test.ts` that verify panel operations survive serialization round-trips. Follow the existing test patterns in that file which use `serializeProject()` → `deserializeProject()` → `compareProjectStates()`. Add new describe blocks for: (1) corner fillets using `SET_CORNER_FILLET` action, (2) all-corner fillets using `SET_ALL_CORNER_FILLET` action, (3) cutouts using `ADD_CUTOUT` action, (4) combined scenario with multiple operation types. Use `createEngineWithAssembly()` from test fixtures. These tests should FAIL initially since serialization doesn't include these operations yet.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] New test file section 'Panel Operations Serialization' with 4+ test cases
- [ ] Tests for corner fillets, all-corner fillets, cutouts each fail with clear message
- [ ] Combined test applies multiple operation types and verifies all are missing after round-trip
- [ ] Tests use existing patterns: TestFixture.basicBox(), checkGeometry(), compareProjectStates()
