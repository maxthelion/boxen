## Context
The helpers `serializePanelOperations()` and `deserializePanelOperations()` already exist in `src/utils/urlState.ts` and their unit tests pass. The 5 failing integration roundtrip tests fail because these helpers are NOT connected to the main pipeline.

Required changes:
1. In `src/utils/urlState.ts`, add `po?: string` field to the `SerializedState` interface (around line 20-30 where other fields are defined)
2. In `src/utils/urlState.ts`, add `panelOperations?: PanelOperation[]` (or similar) to the `ProjectState` interface
3. In `serializeProject()` function in `src/utils/urlState.ts`, call `serializePanelOperations()` to populate the `po` field on the serialized state. The panel operations need to be gathered from the engine snapshot — check how the engine stores panel operations (likely on panel nodes or via `engine.getSnapshot()`)
4. In `deserializeProject()` function in `src/utils/urlState.ts`, call `deserializePanelOperations(serialized.po)` to restore panel operations into the project state
5. In `src/engine/engineInstance.ts` (or wherever `syncStoreToEngine()` lives), re-apply restored panel operations by dispatching `SET_CORNER_FILLET`, `SET_ALL_CORNER_FILLET`, `ADD_CUTOUT` actions to the engine
6. Run `npm run test:run -- tests/integration/serialization/urlState.test.ts` — all 44 tests (39 passing + 5 previously failing) should now pass

IMPORTANT: Do NOT modify the existing 22 passing unit tests or the test structure. Only wire up the pipeline so the 5 integration roundtrip tests pass. Check the existing test expectations carefully — the integration tests may need the serialized input to include panel ops data.

Branch: `feature/dca27809` — check it out first and verify the current state with `git log --oneline -5`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] SerializedState interface has `po` field for panel operations
- [ ] serializeProject() populates `po` field from engine panel operations
- [ ] deserializeProject() restores panel operations from `po` field
- [ ] syncStoreToEngine() dispatches engine actions to re-apply panel operations
- [ ] All 5 previously-failing integration roundtrip tests now pass
- [ ] All 39 previously-passing tests still pass
- [ ] npm run test:run -- tests/integration/serialization/urlState.test.ts shows 0 failures
