## Context
In `/Users/maxwilliams/dev/boxen/src/utils/urlState.ts`, integrate the new helpers into the main serialization flow. In `serializeProject()` (around line 310), call `serializePanelOperations()` and add result to SerializedState as `po` field. In `deserializeProject()` (around line 360), call `deserializePanelOperations()` and add result to ProjectState. Update the ProjectState interface if needed to include panel operations. Ensure the serialized data flows through the LZ-string compression correctly.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] serializeProject() includes panel operations in output
- [ ] deserializeProject() parses panel operations from input
- [ ] ProjectState interface updated with panelOperations field
- [ ] LZ-string compression/decompression works with new data
