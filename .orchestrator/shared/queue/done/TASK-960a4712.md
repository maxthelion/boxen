## Context
Two bugs to fix:

### Bug 1: acceptance_criteria character explosion
When calling create_task() with an acceptance_criteria string, the resulting task file has each character on its own "- [ ]" line instead of preserving the original lines. The acceptance_criteria parameter is being iterated character-by-character when building the checklist section. This affects every task created programmatically with acceptance criteria. See TASK-ea99f944 and TASK-53eb98e8 for examples of the bug (both had to be manually fixed). The bug is in orchestrator/orchestrator/queue_utils.py in the create_task() function, likely where it formats the acceptance criteria into markdown checkboxes.

### Bug 2: scheduler crashes creating worktree for orchestrator_impl
The scheduler's ensure_worktree() tries to create a git worktree from `origin/sqlite-model` in the main repo, but that branch only exists in the orchestrator submodule. This crashes every tick.

The correct model: orchestrator_impl tasks should use `BRANCH: main` like any other agent. The scheduler creates a normal Boxen worktree. The agent then works inside the `orchestrator/` submodule within that worktree (checking out `sqlite-model` there). Commits go to the submodule repo, and the submodule ref update is committed to main.

Fix: update peek_task_branch or the orchestrator_impl prompt so tasks use `main` as the base branch. The agent prompt should instruct the agent to `cd orchestrator && git checkout sqlite-model` as its first step.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Fix the create_task() function so acceptance_criteria lines are preserved as-is
- [ ] If the input already has "- [ ]" prefixes, do not re-wrap
- [ ] If the input has bare lines, add "- [ ]" prefix per line, not per character
- [ ] Add a test that creates a task with multi-line acceptance criteria and verifies the file content is correct
- [ ] orchestrator_impl tasks use BRANCH: main (worktree of Boxen, not submodule branch)
- [ ] Agent prompt instructs working in orchestrator/ submodule within the worktree
- [ ] peek_task_branch returns "main" for orchestrator_impl (or tasks use BRANCH: main)
- [ ] Scheduler logs a clear error (not just a stack trace) when ensure_worktree fails, and continues to next agent instead of crashing the tick
