CHECKS: gk-testing-octopoid

## Context
When an app task reaches provisional with a staging_url, auto-dispatch gk-qa gatekeeper.

Current state: gk-qa defined in agents.yaml (paused), gatekeeper dispatch exists in scheduler, tasks get staging_url from reports._gather_prs(), process_gatekeeper_reviews() handles check results.

What to implement:
1. Unpause gk-qa in agents.yaml (focus: qa, interval: 120s)
2. Auto-add gk-qa check to app tasks when they reach provisional AND have staging_url (like gk-testing-octopoid for orchestrator_impl tasks)
3. gk-qa agent finds tasks with pending gk-qa checks, reads staging_url + acceptance criteria, runs QA evaluation, writes check results
4. Skip tasks without staging_url (deployment not ready yet) — retry on next tick

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] gk-qa agent unpaused in agents.yaml
- [ ] App tasks with staging_url get gk-qa check auto-added
- [ ] gk-qa agent dispatched by scheduler for pending checks
- [ ] Agent runs QA evaluation and writes pass/fail check results
- [ ] Tasks without staging_url are skipped, not failed
- [ ] Tests for dispatch logic and check assignment
